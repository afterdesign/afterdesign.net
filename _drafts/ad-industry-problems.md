If you haven't read engadget article called [You say advertising, I say block that malware](http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/) please go and read it. It's just a basic knowledge what ad networks are serving.

Problems to describe:
1. Ad networks do (would) not care what they are serving (ROI ftw !).
2. Crappy sites with crappy content want to make money.
3. Cheaters are trying to make money instead of creating __something__.
4. Ad networks technology is crappy as hell.
