This is summing up of the 2015 year in which I lost a 3rd of my weight. To be clear I changed every aspect of my life. Every single habit I had went to trash including my work/life balance.

Base on changes I made I can write few thoughts about tech I was using to get where I am.
1. phone
1. miband
1. cheap HR strap with watch
1. counting calories
1. garmin vivofit 2 with HR monitor
